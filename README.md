# About service

This is a very simple package I use for supporting service daemons.  This is
designed to optionally use systemd on GNU/Linux systems, and supports generic
service daemon execution on other (BSD) posix platforms.  It provides
interfaces for both accessing service features and logging.  No specific
service functionality is currently offered for Microsoft Windows.
